# GoogleMapsAssignment

The assignment was about listing the list of nearby restaurants.
we have to use firebase server for storing data as well as for email authentication.
Here one can signup as owner or guest.
Guest can add his/her own restaurant.

I have tested the app on nouget phone as well as marshmllow.
screenshot related to app is in the repository.
